### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rutger, and I'm currently a PhD candidate at [AMOLF](https://amolf.nl/) in biology. On GitHub, you can find the [OrganoidTracker](https://github.com/jvzonlab/OrganoidTracker), the cell tracker that I wrote together with a few others. It uses machine learning to detect cells, so it's completely buzzword-compatible and it also performs well. It's used to follow cells in time lapses of mini-intestines that we culture on a dish. [Watch the movie!](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240802.s003)

### ðŸ”­ Personal projects ðŸ”­
There are also a lot of projects related to Minecraft here, all written for the Minecraft server [Wereldbouw](https://rutgerkok.nl/minecraft/) where I'm an admin. Together, it's a lot of code! I've written a [world editing library](https://github.com/rutgerkok/Hammer/) that works outside Minecraft, a [plugin to protect chests and doors](https://github.com/rutgerkok/BlockLocker) against thieves and a [plugin that makes advanced modifications to world generation](https://github.com/rutgerkok/WorldGeneratorApi) possible.

There are also some no-longer-maintained projects on here, such as a [Google Maps-like live map for Minecraft](https://github.com/rutgerkok/Topographica) or an [entire website content management system](https://github.com/rutgerkok/rCMS) written in PHP, with support for widgets, translations, user roles and categorized content.

### ðŸ“« Contact ðŸ“«
All my repositories have an issues section, feel free to use it for questions, bug reports and other things. For more general things, you can of course also email me. Hoping to hear from you soon!
